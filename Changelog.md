## 0.3.0 ‘Filmed Before a Live Studio Audience’

Released 2024-06-06.

There have been no changes since 0.3.0-rc1.


## 0.3.0-rc1

Released 2024-05-29.

Breaking Changes

* Upgrade Rust edition, minimal Rust version to 1.70, and dependencies.
  ([#88], [#91])
* Removed internal serial numbers and the ability to pass optional diffs
  between units. ([#96])

New

* Added a new `merge` unit that merges the datasets of all its sources.
  ([#110], [#113])
* Added four new configuration options to the HTTP client:
  * `http-root-certs` for additional TLS root certificates,
  * `http-user-agent` for setting a custom user agent,
  * `http-client-addr` to specify a local address to bind to, and
  * `http-proxies` to add HTTP proxies (only available if the `socks` feature
     is enabled which it is by default). ([#111])
* The RTR timer values can now be configured for the RTR target. ([#106])
* The RTR target now produces metrics. By setting `client-metrics: true`
  in its configuration, the target produces separate metrics for each
  client address. ([#115], [#117])
* Log changes made by the `slurm` unit to updates. ([#87])
* The `slurm` unit now updates its data set if it discovers that the Slurm
  files have changed. ([#89])
* Both the `json` unit and target now support conditional HTTP requests
  via the Etag and Last-Modified headers. ([#98])

Bug Fixes

* Fix a race condition where the `slurm` unit would not apply its changes
  to the first update if loading the files is too slow. ([#89])
* Fixed various race conditions during startup and shutdown. ([#101])

Other Changes

* Upgrade the packaging and Docker build workflow to allow for
  cross-compilation. ([#90])

## 0.2.1

Released 2022-03-28.

There have been no changes since 0.2.1-rc1.


## 0.2.1-rc1

Released 2022-03-16.

Bug Fixes

* Fixed an issue that resulted in the `"rtr"` and `"rtr-tls"` targets
  keeping an endlessly growing list of diffs and continuously increasing
  memory consumption. ([#65])

New

* The number of diffs kept by the `"rtr"` and `"rtr-tls"` units can now
  be configured via the new `"history-size"` config option. This new
  option is optional and defaults to 10. ([#65])

[#65]: https://github.com/NLnetLabs/rtrtr/pull/65


## 0.2.0 ‘Arts and Crafts and Tactical Gear’

Released 2022-01-19.

There have been no changes since 0.2.0-rc1.


## 0.2.0-rc1

Released 2022-01-12.

Breaking Changes

* The minimum supported Rust version is now 1.54. ([#45])

New

* Relative paths in config files are now resolved relative to the
  directory the config file is stored in. ([#49], [#50])
* The `"json"` unit now supports the modified JSON format used by newer
  versions of rpki-client. That is, it accepts ASNs as numbers or
  strings and ignores any fields that aren’t essential. ([#30], [#32])
* Added a `"slurm"` unit that can be used to manipulate payload sets based
  on local exception files defined in [RFC 8416]. ([#31])
* Added `"rtr-tls"` unit and target that send RTR data over TLS
  connections. ([#34])
* New metrics for the `"rtr"` and `"rtr-tls"` units list the session ID,
  serial number, and time of the last update, as well as total number of
  bytes read from and sent to the server. ([#40])
* Metrics are now sorted alphabetically (with a few exceptions) in output.
  ([#53])

Bug Fixes

* Corrected the RTR PDU type of the Cache Reset PDU from 7 to 8.
  ([rpki #151])
* The `--config` command line option is now mandatory, resulting in a
  proper error message when it is missing rather than a panic. ([#41])
* The `"json"` unit will not trigger an update if the data source hasn’t
  changed. ([#51])

Other

* Upgraded to Tokio 1.0, Hyper 0.14, and Reqwest 0.11. ([#17])

## 0.1.2 ‘Ten Four’

Released 2021-03-15

New

* The JSON unit ignores the `metadata` field in received files. This
  makes it compatible with the JSON produced by at least Routinator, OctoRPKI,
  and rpki-client. ([#8])

## 0.1.1 ‘Death Metal Karaoke’

Released 2020-12-11

* Support for JSON via HTTP and from a local file as a source, and JSON
  via HTTP as a target. ([#5])

Released 2020-11-09.
